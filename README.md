1. API Programming Language
  Tool: JAVA 8
  Justification: Java has a mature, well-documented ecosystem with a wide range of libraries and tools that simplify API creation and maintenance


2. Database

Tool: Oracle

Justification: Proven stability with very large datasets and concurrent users. Excellent for OLTP (transactional) and OLAP (analytical) workloads.


3. Data Warehousing

Tool: Snowflake

Justification: Fully Managed Cloud-Native Platform, No infrastructure to manage: provisioning, scaling, tuning, and backups are handled automatically. Available across AWS, Azure, and GCP.


4. Version Control

Tool: Git & GitHub

Justification: Git enables efficient version control and collaboration, while GitHub provides cloud-based repository hosting, issue tracking, and integration with CI/CD tools.


5. Testing

Tool: Swagger & JUnit 5

Justification: Swagger is a powerful and easy-to-use testing framework for java api, with strong community support and plugins for coverage, fixtures, and mocking.

6. API Framework

Tool: RESTful API

Justification: Simple, stateless communication REST APIs are great for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
              Web-friendly architecture. If your API is being accessed via browsers or HTTP clients, REST integrates naturally with standard web protocols. Ease of use and wide support REST is supported in virtually all modern programming languages, frameworks, and                    tools. Scalability statelessness (each request contains all info needed) supports scaling out with ease. Resource-based modeling REST is excellent when your application has clear "resources" (e.g., users, products, orders).
